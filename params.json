  "body": "# React Webpack Tutorial\r\n\r\nThis tutorial will cover how to get started developing a client side application using these technologies:\r\n- [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)\r\n- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)\r\n- [Npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)\r\n\r\nYou can either follow the tutorial below or just jump to the resulting code with:\r\n\r\n1. Cloning this repo `git clone git@github.com:jansoren/react-webpack-tutorial.git`\r\n1. Run `npm install` from the [myapp](https://github.com/jansoren/react-webpack-tutorial/tree/master/myapp)-folder\r\n1. Run command `webpack`\r\n1. Open `/myapp/dist/index.html`\r\n\r\nIf you find the tutorial helpful, and maybe learned something new, please give it a star [here](https://github.com/jansoren/react-webpack-tutorial).\r\nIf you have improvement suggestions please create an issue or a pull request. Enjoy :-)\r\n\r\n## Tutorial prerequisites\r\n\r\n- Use your preferred IDE or you can install [Atom](https://atom.io/)\r\n- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\r\n- Install [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - `npm install -g webpack`\r\n\r\n### 1. Initializing your project with npm\r\n\r\n1. Enter your project main folder. For this tutorial I will use [myapp](https://github.com/jansoren/react-webpack-tutorial/tree/master/myapp) as folder and you will find the resulting code there\r\n1. Run `npm init` to create the project `package.json` file\r\n1. Press <enter> on the npm init questions to get the default value\r\n1. Install Webpack with `npm install --save-dev webpack`. When npm uses `--save-dev` it automatically adds the webpack package to the `package.json`\r\n\r\nYou have now created an initial [package.json](https://github.com/jansoren/react-webpack-tutorial/tree/master/myapp/package.json) file that we later on will fill with the necessary packages for installing the application with `npm install`.\r\n\r\n### 2. Create initial application files\r\n\r\n1. Open [myapp](https://github.com/jansoren/react-webpack-tutorial/tree/master/myapp)-folder in your preferred IDE or [Atom](https://atom.io/)\r\n1. Create your application Webpack config file [webpack.config.js](https://github.com/jansoren/react-webpack-tutorial/tree/master/myapp/webpack.config.js) in main project folder with this initial content:\r\n  ```javascript\r\n  var config = {\r\n    context: __dirname + \"/app\",\r\n    entry: \"./main.js\",\r\n\r\n    output: {\r\n      filename: \"bundle.js\",\r\n      path: __dirname + \"/dist\",\r\n    },\r\n  };\r\n  module.exports = config;\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n1. Create folder [myapp/app](https://github.com/jansoren/react-webpack-tutorial/tree/master/myapp/app) to contain all your application files.\r\n1. Create your application main file [main.js](https://github.com/jansoren/react-webpack-tutorial/tree/master/myapp/app/main.js) with this initial content:\r\n  ```javascript\r\n  var React = require('react');\r\n  var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');\r\n\r\n  var Content = React.createClass({\r\n    render: function() {\r\n      return (\r\n        <div>\r\n          <b>Congratulations</b>, you are now ready to implement your client side application! Enjoy :-)\r\n        </div>\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n  ReactDOM.render(<Content />, document.getElementById('content'));\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n1. Install React DOM and add it to your package.json file automatically using `npm install --save react react-dom`\r\n1. Install Babel to transform the content of a .js file from ES6 to ES5 `npm install --save-dev babel-preset-react babel-preset-es2015 babel-core babel-loader`\r\n1. In your `webpack.config.js` add the babel-loader that you just installed like this:\r\n  ```javascript\r\n  var config = {\r\n    ...\r\n    module: {\r\n      loaders: [\r\n        {\r\n          test: /\\.js$/,\r\n          exclude: /node_modules/,\r\n          loader: 'babel-loader',\r\n          query: {\r\n            presets: ['react', 'es2015']\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n    },\r\n  };\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n1. Create folder [myapp/dist](https://github.com/jansoren/react-webpack-tutorial/tree/master/myapp/dist) and create `index.html` file with content:\r\n  ```html\r\n  <!DOCTYPE html>\r\n  <html>\r\n    <head>\r\n      <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\r\n      <title>Hello React Webpack Tutorial!</title>\r\n    </head>\r\n    <body>\r\n      <div id=\"content\"></div>\r\n      <script src=\"bundle.js\"></script>\r\n    </body>\r\n  </html>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n1. Run command `webpack` in your main folder that will result in something like this:\r\n  ```\r\n  Hash: dd141258ef660950584c\r\n  Version: webpack 1.12.11\r\n  Time: 3711ms\r\n    Asset    Size  Chunks             Chunk Names\r\n  bundle.js  676 kB       0  [emitted]  main\r\n    + 159 hidden modules\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n1. Open `/dist/index.html` to see your client side application\r\n\r\n1.
